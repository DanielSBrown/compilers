To the Grader: we emailed Professor Soffa about our assignment, since we turned it in late. Just FYI

the file structure is as such:
in PA5Start/ there will be the makefile to make everything.
Also in PA5Start/ is a tests/ folder that contains the test files for this assignment. the ones that have "_incorrect" should fail when trying to compile with lookupInnermost
Specifically, PA4Test4_incorrect will fail because it tries to instantiate a class to a variable instead of just doing "new obj.func()" in one line.
PA4Test5_incorrect fails because there is no '>' in PA4...nor is it in MeggyJava at all I don't think
Same with PA5

We tried really hard to get everything done iwth Symbol Table, but it took so long since we didn't finish PA4. Also, it ws tough to do this during exams. Please be gentle
